In most programming languages, including Python, strings are enclosed in quotation marks (single or double). \n",

    "#### Ans-An expression in programming is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that can be evaluated to produce a result. Expressions are a fundamental part of programming languages and are used to perform computations, make decisions, and manipulate data. They can be as simple as a single constant value or as complex as a combination of multiple operations."
